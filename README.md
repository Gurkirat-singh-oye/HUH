# Intro
In an attempt to learn more about git, I am trying to make one myself.
what better way to understand something than to make one yourself.

# Commands
- init
- cat-file
- ls-files

# Limitations
- functionality of cat-file is limited

# Using _HUH_ anywhere in linux
Add the following line to your "_~/.bashrc_" file:
- export PATH=$PATH:[here goes the path to _huh_]
